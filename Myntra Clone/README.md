Only the Myntra symbol is working, as well as the bag symbol. Myntra will be directed to the home page, where all the products are shown ,where you can add or remove the product from the bag, and when you click on the bag, you will be directed to the bag page, where the product summary and the product that you choose will be shown. You can remove the product from the bag, and it will reflect on the product summary.
